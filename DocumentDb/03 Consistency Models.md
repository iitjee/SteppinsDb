It's very important to understand the consistency models in DocumentDB as it is one of the very few databases that provides us with a wide variety of those. A default consistency level can be configured on your database accounts. This applies to all collections across all of the databases. All reads and queries of the user-defined resources will by default, use the consistency level specified on the database account.
