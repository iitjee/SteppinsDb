- When DocumentDB stores documents, it distributes them evenly among partitions based on the partition key value. The throughput is also distributed evenly among the available partitions, that is throughput per partition which equals total throughput per collection divided by the number of partitions.
In order to achieve the full throughput of the collection you must use a partition key. That allows you to evenly distribute requests among a number of distinct partition key. DocumentDB supports the creation of both a single partition as well as a partition collection.

A partition collection can span multiple partitions and support vary large amount of storage and throughput. You must specify a partition key for the collection though and a single partition collection has a lower price option and it also has ability to query and perform transactions across all colleciton data. They have the scalability and storage limits of a single partition. You do not have to specify a partition key for these collections. So here's an example of a single partition collection. In this case, assuming my company only worked with small size businesses.
